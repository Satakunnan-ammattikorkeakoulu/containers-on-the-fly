# .cursorrules for Containers on the Fly - Docker Container Reservation Platform

## Project Overview
# This is a web-based Docker container reservation platform that allows users to reserve
# Docker containers with specific hardware resources and time slots. The system supports
# multiple container servers and includes admin management tools.

## Architecture
# - Frontend: Vue.js 2 with Vuetify (webapp/frontend/)
# - Backend: Python 3 with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (webapp/backend/) 
# - Database: MariaDB with defined schema
# - Reverse Proxy: Caddy with automatic HTTPS
# - Process Management: pm2
# - Container Management: Docker + custom utility
# - Build System: Make with comprehensive automation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Patterns
# Python Backend:
- Use FastAPI with dependency injection patterns
- Follow SQLAlchemy ORM patterns established in database.py
- Maintain separation: endpoints/ -> responses/ -> helpers/tables/ -> database
- Use session management with context managers: `with Session() as session:`
- Follow existing authentication patterns using ForceAuthentication() and CheckToken()
- Use the Response helper for consistent API responses
- Keep admin routes separate in adminRoutes/ subdirectory
- Use proper type hints where established

# Vue.js Frontend:
- Follow Vue 2 composition patterns with Vuetify components
- Maintain store/ pattern with Vuex for state management
- Keep components organized: admin/, user/, global/
- Follow existing routing patterns in router/
- Use layouts/ for page structure
- Maintain responsive design with Vuetify grid system

### Security Focus
# Since security fixes are planned, always consider:
- Authentication and authorization on ALL endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (use SQLAlchemy properly)
- XSS prevention in frontend
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting considerations
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Session management and token validation
- Admin-only endpoint protection with role checking

### Database Patterns
# Database System:
- MariaDB with SQLAlchemy ORM + PyMySQL driver
- Connection pooling configured for scalability
- UTF8MB4 character set with unicode_ci collation
- InnoDB engine for transaction support

# When making database changes:
- Update models in database.py first
- Add helper functions in helpers/tables/
- Use proper relationships and foreign keys
- Maintain existing naming conventions (camelCase for columns)
- Add migrations carefully since this affects production data
- Follow existing patterns for created/updated timestamps
- Use proper indexing for performance
- Consider MariaDB specifics:
  * Use TIMESTAMP(6) for microsecond precision
  * TEXT fields for variable strings
  * Watch index key length limits
  * Choose appropriate column types

# Database Migration Process:
- Use `make create-migration MESSAGE="message"` for new migrations
- Use `make migrate-database` to apply migrations
- Review migration files in backend/alembic/versions/
- Test migrations locally before committing
- Never edit migrations after production deployment
- Always backup production database first
- Keep migrations atomic (one change per migration)
- Include both upgrade and downgrade paths
- Consider MariaDB-specific migration impacts:
  * Lock times during schema changes
  * Table size impact on migration duration
  * Online schema changes when possible

### API Endpoint Patterns
# For new endpoints:
- Use FastAPI router patterns in endpoints/
- Implement business logic in endpoints/responses/
- Use OAuth2PasswordBearer for authentication
- Apply ForceAuthentication() decorator with proper role checking
- Separate admin endpoints into adminRoutes/
- Use proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Follow existing parameter and response patterns

### Frontend Development
# For UI enhancements:
- Use Vuetify components consistently
- Follow existing color schemes and styling
- Maintain mobile responsiveness
- Use proper Vue 2 patterns (avoid Vue 3 syntax)
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Follow existing naming conventions for components and files
- Use proper error handling and loading states

### Configuration Management
# Settings and configuration:
- Use user_config/settings for environment-specific settings
- Update templates in user_config/templates/ when needed
- Use scripts/apply_settings.py for template processing
- Follow existing Make targets for deployment
- Consider backwards compatibility for existing installations

### Development Commands
# Common development workflows:
- `make start-dev-frontend` - Start frontend development server
- `make start-dev-backend` - Start backend development server  
- `make start-dev-docker-utility` - Start Docker utility for testing
- `make apply-settings` - Apply configuration changes
- `make logs` - View server logs
- `make status` - Check server status

### File Organization
# Maintain existing structure:
webapp/
├── backend/
│   ├── endpoints/ (API routes)
│   ├── helpers/ (business logic)
│   ├── docker/ (container management)
│   └── database.py (ORM models)
└── frontend/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/ (Vue components)
    │   ├── pages/ (route components)
    │   ├── layouts/ (page layouts)
    │   └── store/ (Vuex store)

### Dependencies
# Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PyMySQL, ldap3, python-on-whales
# Frontend: Vue.js 2, Vuetify, Vue Router, Vuex, axios, dayjs

### Performance & Scalability
# Consider these factors:
- Database connection pooling is configured
- Container port range management (2000-3000 default)
- Multiple server support architecture
- Resource allocation and hardware specs handling
- Session timeout and cleanup

### Docker & Deployment
# Container and deployment patterns:
- Use existing Dockerfile patterns
- Follow Docker registry patterns (port 5000)
- Maintain pm2 process management patterns
- Use Caddy configuration patterns for reverse proxy
- Consider firewall rules when adding new services
- Test with Ubuntu 24.04 deployment environment

### Common Gotchas
# Avoid these issues:
- Don't break the Make-based deployment system
- Maintain backwards compatibility for user_config/settings
- Don't hardcode ports or IPs (use configuration)
- Be careful with database schema changes in production
- Maintain existing authentication patterns
- Don't break the multi-server architecture support
- Consider timezone handling for scheduling
- Validate hardware resource allocations properly

### Future-Proofing
# When implementing new features:
- Design for multi-tenancy where applicable
- Maintain audit trails for admin actions
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Consider monitoring and logging needs
- Plan for backup and recovery scenarios

### Git Patterns
# Never commit:
- user_config/settings (use settings_example)
- webapp/backend/settings.json
- Any files with real passwords/tokens
