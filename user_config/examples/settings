# MAIN SERVER CONFIGURATIONS

###

# The IP address of your server. This value is required to be set correctly.
SERVER_IP_ADDRESS="YOUR_IP_HERE"

# The full address to your web server which you can access from the browser.
# For example: "http://127.0.0.1", or "https://mycoolserver.com", or "http://4.512.512.712"
# Note that if you want to access the server from the internet, then you need to make sure that there is no firewall blocking the access to the server (port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS).
SERVER_WEB_ADDRESS="http://127.0.0.1"

# Name of your app.
APP_NAME="Containers on the Fly"

# Minimum and maximum duration (in hours) for a container reservation.
# Default: minimum 5, maximum 72
# For example, with the default settings, user needs to reserve the container for at least 5 hours but can reserve it for a maximum of 72 hours.
# Change these to your own needs.
RESERVATION_MIN_DURATION=5
RESERVATION_MAX_DURATION=72

#####
# MARIADB DATABASE CONFIGURATIONS
# 
# While installing, these configurations are used to configure the installed MariaDB database.
# While starting the servers or docker utility, these configurations are used to connect to the database.
# You can leave the default options here, but be sure to change the password.
#####

# MariaDB server address. Leave it as "localhost" if running the database on the current computer.
# Otherwise, specify the IP address or domain of another server here.

# Name of the database to use.
MARIADB_DB_NAME="containerfly"
# User in the database to use.
MARIADB_DB_USER="containerflyuser"

# Change this to something more secure before beginning the setup / installation.

# DOCKER CONFIGURATIONS
# 
###

# In what address is the Docker registry (local Docker image distribution) running.
# If this is your main server, then just leave the default value and port here.
# Otherwise, if this is a separate container server, then insert the IP and port of the main server here. For example: "51.115.104.42" and 5000.
DOCKER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=$SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
DOCKER_REGISTRY_PORT=5000 # Change this port only if you know what you are doing :)

# This is the port range from which reserved containers can be accessed through.
# When user reserves a container and the container is being started, a random available port is selected from this range.
# Note that if you want these reserved containers to be accessed outside the server, then you need to open this port range in the firewall(s).
DOCKER_RESERVATION_PORT_RANGE_START=2000
DOCKER_RESERVATION_PORT_RANGE_END=3000

# Name / ID of the server.
# This is used by the backend docker utility to start the reserved docker container in the correct server.
# This should be the same as specified in the database for the computer as a name.
# For example: "server1"
DOCKER_SERVER_NAME="server1"

# Additionally, if you want your users to persistently store files and folders,
# you can specify here the full path in the host operating system where the files are stored at.
# Each user will have a folder in this location for saving persistent data, with the user's email (special characters removed) as the folder name.
# For example: "/home/containerfly/persistent_mounts"
# It could then store user test@foo.com data as: "/home/containerfly/persistent_mounts/test_foo_com/"
DOCKER_USER_MOUNT_LOCATION=""

# User in the host system who will own the mounted folder. This needs to exist.
# Default value: "root"
DOCKER_MOUNT_USER="root"
# Group in the host system who will own the mounted folder.
# Default value: "docker"
DOCKER_MOUNT_GROUP="docker"

# If you want to also add additional mounts for every container (like a read-only folder(s) from the host system),
# Then take a look at the backend_settings.json file and the commented out example configuration there for setting "extraMounts"
