# WEB SERVER CONFIGURATIONS
# 
# The web server configurations below are only required to be set in the server where you will host the web servers.
# They will only be used by the 'make setup-webservers' and 'make run-webservers' make tasks.
###

# The IP address of your server.
SERVER_IP_ADDRESS="YOUR_IP_HERE"

# The full address to your web server which you can access from the browser.
# For example: "http://127.0.0.1", "https://mycoolserver.com", "http://4.512.512.712"
SERVER_WEB_ADDRESS="http://127.0.0.1"

# Name of your app.
APP_NAME="Containers on the Fly"

# Minimum and maximum duration (in hours) for a container reservation.
# Default: minimum 5, maximum 72
# For example, with the default settings, user needs to reserve the container for at least 5 hours but can reserve it for a maximum of 72 hours.
# Change these to your own needs.
RESERVATION_MIN_DURATION=5
RESERVATION_MAX_DURATION=72

#####
# MARIADB DATABASE CONFIGURATIONS
# 
# While installing, these configurations are used to configure the installed MariaDB database.
# While starting the servers or docker utility, these configurations are used to connect to the database.
#####

# MariaDB server address. Leave it as "localhost" if running the database on the current computer.
# Otherwise, specify the IP address or domain of another server here.
MARIADB_SERVER_ADDRESS="localhost"
# Name of the database to use.
MARIADB_DB_NAME="containerfly"
# User in the database to use.
MARIADB_DB_USER="containerflyuser"
# Database user password.
# Change this to something more secure before beginning the setup / installation.
MARIADB_DB_USER_PASSWORD="password"

# DOCKER CONFIGURATIONS
# 
###

# In what address is the Docker registry (local Docker image distribution) running.
# If it is running in the current server (main server), then just leave the default values "localhost" and 5000 here.
# Otherwise, if you are running the main server in different server (thus this would be a separate container server), then insert the IP and port of the main server here. For example: "51.115.104.42" and 5000.
DOCKER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS="localhost"
DOCKER_REGISTRY_PORT=5000

# This is the port range from which reserved containers can be accessed through.
# When user reserves a container and the container is being started, a random available port is selected from this range.
# Note that if you want these reserved containers to be accessed outside the server, then you need to open these ports in the firewall(s).
DOCKER_RESERVATION_PORT_RANGE_START=2000
DOCKER_RESERVATION_PORT_RANGE_END=3000

# Name / ID of the server.
# This is used by the backend docker utility to start the reserved docker container in the correct server.
# This should be the same as specified in the database for the computer as a name.
# For example: "server1"
DOCKER_SERVER_NAME="server1"

# Additionally, if you want your users to persistently store files and folders,
# you can specify here the full path in the host operating system where the files are stored at.
# Each user will have a folder in this location for saving persistent data, with the user's email (special characters removed) as the folder name.
# For example: "/home/containerfly/persistent_mounts"
DOCKER_USER_MOUNT_LOCATION=""

# User in the host system who will own the mounted folder. This needs to exist.
# Default value: "root"
DOCKER_MOUNT_USER="root"
# Group in the host system who will own the mounted folder.
# Default value: "docker"
DOCKER_MOUNT_GROUP="docker"

# If you want to also add additional mounts for every container (like a read-only folder(s) from the host system),
# Then take a look at the backend_settings.json file and the commented out example configuration there for setting "extraMounts"
